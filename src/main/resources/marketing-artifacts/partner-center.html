<p>This offer automatically provisions several Azure resources to quickly move to IBM WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty on the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The provisioned resources include an Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance, an AKS cluster and the Liberty Operator. The offer can also deploy Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty Container (e.g., Docker) images. After initial provisioning you can focus on deploying your Liberty application to AKS, using DevOps tools such as GitHub Actions, UrbanCode Deploy or Gitlab Ultimate.</p>
<p>This offer is Bring-Your-Own-License, and assumes you have sufficient entitlements. WebSphere Liberty is available as a limited Trial option before entitlement is required. Open Liberty is open source and free to use unsupported.  You can also use OpenLiberty supported through WebSphere Liberty entitlements. When using WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty supported, usage should be tracked using the <a href="https://github.com/IBM/ibm-licensing-operator">License Service Operator</a>. </p>
